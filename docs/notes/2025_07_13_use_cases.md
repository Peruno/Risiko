In order to create a nice UI, I want to get an overview of the use cases first. After identifying all different use
types / workflows of the user, I can try to bring a bit of order into it. I hope that then it will be clear what the
UI / UX should be like.

All usages I can think of start with the same input: providing the number of attackers and defenders. Then there are two
modi: Safe-Attack and All-In. For both, the user could be interested in all of these:

* What is the probability that I win / loose overall?
  * all-in: win / loss
  * safe-attack: win / stoppage
* How does the probability distribution of the different outcomes look like?
* Simulate an outcome.

Additionally, the user could want some information about how the calculation is done. This would help in case of
unlikely outcomes where the user might be angry and loose trust in the correctness of the program. So maybe here I can
recycle the blogpost I once wrote.

# Result
I want a top-level page that contains
* input attackers
* input defenders
* "a/b slider" to select between all-in and safe-attack
* Button "show probabilities" (need a good term in german here)
  * -> shows probabilities
  * offers a new button: "detailed statistics" that then displays the diagram (yet to be created) 
    * this should be a "new page", what ever that means and offer a close-button that returns to the main page
  * Button "simulate result"
