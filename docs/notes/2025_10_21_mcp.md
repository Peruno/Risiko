What remains to be done until I can finally release the app? The most important thing is the styling of the diagram. I
want it to use the space of the screen well. The titles and labels of the axes should be well readable. They should be
positioned well, too. When there is a single title, it should be centralized. When there are two, they should be
centralized within their respective area, up to some padding of course. The percentages on the left should not be cut
off. The left label should not be too close to the percentages. And so forth. I assume that this all can be achieved by
vibe coding, but it will take many iterations, and it could also become very dirty. That could be fine, as long as the
output is formatted well and this is consistent across different end devices. I could then later clean up the codebase:
Understand the concepts, split the classes, reduce the complexity, remove hard coded values etc., like I've done it
before. It is likely, that this will further improve the UI, but this should not block me from releasing the app in the
meantime. I think that those little changes I listed are already so time-consuming, that it would be worth it to set up
an MCP server of some kind, such that the model can get the necessary feedback directly. So this will be my next step:

1. some research on how to do this (for the IOS simulator)
2. setting it up
3. feeding claude code what I just wrote as desired changes and watching it loop on
