My goal is to build an app for the Risiko simulation. 

* it should run on all smartphone types
* it should be easy to install, ideally via the app stores
* it should use best practices for app development
* it should have a lean, intuitive UI and be easy to use


Along the way I want to learn:

* working on a project on my own, consistently
* get an overview of and a feeling for the basic concepts and technologies involved in app development
* power use of AI


The way of work shall be close to vibe coding, but with the condition that I understand everything that happens.
