# Todo
* Styling of the detailed diagram
* Research: Is the name "Risiko" proprietary/licensed?
* Release it to the Apple App Store
* Release it to the Google App Store
* Write a README
* Refactor the detailed diagram
* Refactor simulator.dart
* Refactor battle_simulator_page.dart
  * Validation logic contains duplication and could make smarter use of the state


# Maybe One Day
* Experiment: don't show buttons (Chancen berechnen, Ergebnis simulieren, Detailliertes Diagramm) from the start, but
  only after input has been given. Instead, show some kind of greeting
* Replace keyboard by something to scroll
* Wololo Sound bei einer zu null Klatsche
