# Todo
* Write a README
* Ensure that the scales are equal in the left and right so the user can see the binomial distribution
  * Maybe move the middle depending on the inputs
  * Consider cutting off very small values
  * Scale should use round numbers (e.g. 5, 10, but not 4, 9)
* Release it to the Apple App Store
* Release it to the Google App Store


# Maybe One Day
* Experiment: don't show buttons (Chancen berechnen, Ergebnis simulieren, Detailliertes Diagramm) from the start, but
  only after input has been given. Instead, show some kind of greeting
* Replace keyboard by something to scroll
* Wololo Sound bei einer zu null Klatsche
* Adapt Claude such that the commits are signed by me not by claude
